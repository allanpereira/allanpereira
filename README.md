## ðŸŒŸ Career highlights
### 4all
#### Software Engineer - Feb 2017 - Oct 2018
4all was one of the pioneer companies of digital wallets segment in Brazil. It was created by the founder of the GetNet, 
which later become the ["first brazilian unicorn"](https://amanha.com.br/categoria/empreendedorismo/especial-o-ze-do-banrisul-da-kombi-e-do-unicornio),
when 1B US$ worth companies were not even called this way (2014).

This was my first opportunity to work in a startup and I had a huge evolution during this time. 

### Leveros / Profiz
#### Founding Software Engineer - Jan 2019 - Apr 2021
Leveros is the one of the biggest retail sellers in Brazil.

I was invited to join as part of the engineering founding team of a newly created company (called Profiz). This was one 
of the greatest oportunities of my career because I had the chance to built from the scratch, literally from the 
whiteboard drafts until the product releases in production.
